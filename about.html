              Els Van Den Steen is a calligrapher who lives in Maidstone, Kent. She has been fascinated by the beauty and movement of line since her first handwriting lessons at primary school in Belgium. Els qualified as primary teacher in Brussels, in 1982. In 1988 her husbandâ€™s job brought them to England. <br><br>
              While Els continued teaching full time as primary teacher, she started her first calligraphy lessons with Augusto Fiorani at Adult Education Gillingham (Kent) in 1990, just as a hobby. As her interest grew, she joined her regional calligraphy group Cinque Ports Scribes in 1993 where she has attended numerous workshops. Over the years she has developed her calligraphic skills with many influential calligraphers, national and international. Els is also a member of the Calligraphy and Lettering Arts Society and of the Society of Scribes & Illuminators.
              To share her skill, passion and enthusiasm for calligraphy, Els started teaching calligraphy at Adult Education Kent in 1999, covering Maidstone, Sevenoaks and Tonbridge. Since 2019 she has been running her own weekly, private classes in person and online.<br><br>
              Using historical, traditional scripts as a base, Els enjoys breaking the rules to develop a more contemporary style of calligraphy, combined with a range of experimental techniques.
